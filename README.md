# Instrumentation Amplifier
Designed and implemented an Instrumentation Amplifier in LTSpice using LT1013 operational amplifier with the following specifications-

1. V<sub>out</sub> = 4(V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>2</sub>)
2. Frequency range of V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> is 1kHz - 10kHz
3. Less than 0.1 dB gain variation in signal frequency
4. Single source supply of 30V
5. Load of 10kÎ©
